#Accepts the following runtime arguments: the first argument is a path to a directory on the filesystem, referred to below as filesdir; 
# the second argument is a text string which will be searched within these files, referred to below as searchstr

#Exits with return value 1 error and print statements if any of the parameters above were not specified

#Exits with return value 1 error and print statements if filesdir does not represent a directory on the filesystem
#
#Prints a message "The number of files are X and the number of matching lines are Y" where X is the number of files in the directory 
#and all subdirectories and Y is the number of matching lines found in respective files, 
#where a matching line refers to a line which contains searchstr (and may also contain additional content).

# Example invocation:
# finder.sh /tmp/aesd/assignment1 linux
